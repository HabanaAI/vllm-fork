"You are an AI designed to generate extremely long, detailed worldbuilding content. Your goal is to write a fictional encyclopedia with at least 4000 words of content. Do not stop early. Start by describing a fictional planet in detail. Include: \n1. Geography and climate zones (with rich, varied description).\n2. The history of all civilizations, from ancient to modern times.\n3. Cultures, belief systems, and mythologies along with rich detail about where such beliefs came from.\n4. Political structures and conflicts along with their history.\n5. Technology and magic systems (if any) spanning the last 1000 years, highlighting significant discoveries and figures.\n6. Major historical events and characters along with their geneology.\n\n Be descriptive, verbose, and never summarize. Write in a factual tone like an academic encyclopedia. Begin your entry below:",

'''Here is a short story: It contains some animals as its main characters. Rewrite this story by replacing the animals in this story with any of the animals shown in the images. Do not change the contents of the story, just the characters: One day a shepherd discovered a fat Pig in the meadow where his Sheep were pastured. He very quickly captured the porker, which squealed at the top of its voice the moment the Shepherd laid his hands on it. You would have thought, to hear the loud squealing, that the Pig was being cruelly hurt. But in spite of its squeals and struggles to escape, the Shepherd tucked his prize under his arm and started off to the butcher's in the market place. The Sheep in the pasture were much astonished and amused at the Pig's behavior, and followed the Shepherd and his charge to the pasture gate. "What makes you squeal like that?" asked one of the Sheep. "The Shepherd often catches and carries off one of us. But we should feel very much ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do." "That is all very well," replied the Pig, with a squeal and a frantic kick. "When he catches you he is only after your wool. But he wants my bacon! gree-ee-ee!"''',

    Let me break this down step by step.
    
    Given information:
    - Engineering: 50 people
    - Sales: 30 people  
    - Marketing: 20 people
    - Each team needs: 2 Engineering + 1 Sales + 1 Marketing = 4 people total
    
    Question 1: How many complete teams can they form?
    
    For each team, I need:
    - 2 people from Engineering (50 available)
    - 1 person from Sales (30 available)
    - 1 person from Marketing (20 available)
    
    The limiting factor will be the department that runs out first when forming teams.
    
    From Engineering: 50 ÷ 2 = 25 possible teams
    From Sales: 30 ÷ 1 = 30 possible teams  
    From Marketing: 20 ÷ 1 = 20 possible teams
    
    The limiting factor is Marketing with only 20 people, so we can form 20 complete teams.
    
    Question 2: How many people will be left over?
    
    If we form 20 teams:
    - Engineering used: 20 × 2 = 40 people, leaving 50 - 40 = 10 people
    - Sales used: 20 × 1 = 20 people, leaving 30 - 20 = 10 people
    - Marketing used: 20 × 1 = 20 people, leaving 20 - 20 = 0 people
    
    Question 3: To include everyone, what additional people are needed?
    
    We have 10 Engineering + 10 Sales + 0 Marketing = 20 people left over.
    To form additional teams with the 2:1:1 ratio, we need Marketing people.
    
    We could form 5 more teams if we had 5 more Marketing people (since we have 10 Engineering for 5 teams, and 10 Sales for 10 teams).
    
    So we need to hire 5 additional Marketing people.
    <|/reasoning|>
    
    <|final|>
    Looking at this step-by-step:
    
    1. **Complete teams possible**: 20 teams
       - Marketing is the limiting factor (20 people ÷ 1 per team = 20 teams)
    
    2. **People left over**:
       - Engineering: 10 people (50 - 40 used)
       - Sales: 10 people (30 - 20 used)  
       - Marketing: 0 people (20 - 20 used)
    
    3. **To include everyone**: Hire 5 additional Marketing people
       - This would allow forming 5 more teams using the remaining 10 Engineering and 10 Sales people
       - Total teams would then be 25, with everyone included
